This is the main model class file used for the [VRAE](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6581) (ICLR 2015 workshops)

For preprocessing the MIDI files into numpy ndarrays, we used code from the RNN-RBM model by Boulanger-Lewandowski et al. found [here](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/rnnrbm.html). Direct download via [here](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/deep/midi.zip), see specifically the util.py file.

For some example code on how to use this class refer to [Variational-Autoencoder](https://github.com/y0ast/Variational-Autoencoder), which uses largely the same structure.
